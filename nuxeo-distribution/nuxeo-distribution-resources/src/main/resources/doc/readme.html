  <h1>Nuxeo Document Management 5.3.2-SNAPSHOT Release Notes</h1>

  <p>Welcome to Nuxeo Document Management (DM) 5.3.2-SNAPSHOT.</p>
  
  <p>Download  latest release of Nuxeo DM from <a href="http://www.nuxeo.com/en/downloads">http://www.nuxeo.com/en/downloads</a></p>

  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  
  <p>Nuxeo DM 5.3 needs Java. Please install and set up the recommended <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">Sun Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 6</a> if it's not already installed on your computer. (Don't worry if you have the JDK 6 installed, though).</p>

  <p>Nuxeo is also compliant with the older Java 5, but support for it is likely to be dropped in a future release.</p>
  
  <p>We've also had success running Nuxeo DM on the OpenJDK 6 (the default version of Java installed on most Linux distributions). We don't consider the OpenJDK as a supported platform yet, but we welcome your feedback if you encounter any trouble with it.</p>
  
  <p>It won't work with any previous release of Java (e.g. Java 1.4).</p>
  
  <p>Under Windows, virus scan should be configured to avoid scanning Nuxeo's installation folder. More details on <a href="http://www.nuxeo.org/xwiki/bin/view/FAQ/virusCheck"> this FAQ entry </a>.
