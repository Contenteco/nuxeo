<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<p>The applications based on Nuxeo EP 5.5 need Java. Please install and
set up the recommended <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Sun Java Development Kit (JDK) 6</a> if it&#8217;s not
already installed on your computer.</p>

<p>Nuxeo Platform 5.5 supports OpenJDK 6 as a default Java setup.
We don&#8217;t consider Java 7 as a supported version yet, but we welcome
your feedback if you encounter any trouble with it.</p>

<p>It won&#8217;t work with any previous release of Java (e.g. Java 5).</p>

<p>Under Windows, virus scan should be configured to avoid scanning
Nuxeo&#8217;s installation folder. More details on <a href="https://doc.nuxeo.com/x/ngQz">this FAQ entry</a>.</p>
